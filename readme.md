# Accident CCTV Detection System

The Accident CCTV Detection System is a real-time solution designed to automatically detect accidents or violence using CCTV footage. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning algorithms, the system continuously monitors traffic patterns and identifies anomalies that could indicate accidents.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for building fast and user-friendly web applications.

### Backend
- **Object Detection**:
  - **YOLOv8 Classification**: A state-of-the-art object detection model used for identifying and classifying incidents from CCTV footage.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**:
  - **OpenAI GPT-4**: Used for natural language processing tasks to enhance the system's decision-making capabilities, including understanding accident reports and providing insights based on the detected incidents.
